Modified version of the ThinMatrix YouTube tutorial series to create a 3D game

<b>Unity3D low poly FPS using the Mirror multiplayer framework</b> <br>
This is a 1v1 game with the objective to win the most amount of rounds.
I built this game to prototype a multiplayer game with mirror, however I intend to continue working on the game and eventually make it available for free. I'm hoping to eventually add a hat powerup system to the game where apon picking up a hat it will give you different abilities to spice up the gameplay.
